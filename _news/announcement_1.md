I am excited to share my presentation at the [2024 IEPC](https://www.conftool.com/iepc2024/index.php?page=browseSessions&print=export&ismobile=false) in Toulouse, France was selected as the Best Paper of the Electrostatic Thrusters Session. The conference proceeding was invited for publication in a special issue of the [Journal of Electric Propulsion](https://link.springer.com/journal/44205), which we hope to share soon!
