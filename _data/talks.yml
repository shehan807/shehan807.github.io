    - title: Micro-Cold Trap Detection and Characterization on the Lunar Surface
      institution: Caltech SURF Presentation
      year: 2018
      location: Pasadena, CA
      description:
        - "Advised by Sylvain Piqueux and Catherine Elder, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"
      abstract: "Lunar micro-cold traps are putative centimeter-scale (or larger) regions cold enough for ice or other volatiles to be trapped and stable over long time periods on planetary bodies. The objective of this project was to demonstrate their existence on the Moon and characterize their properties. The southern hemisphere of the Moon, particularly at latitudes 85Â° and higher, exhibits partially or permanently shaded regions with sub-110 K temperatures as demonstrated by Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner reflected solar and emitted infrared radiances measured through nine spectral channels. Micro-cold traps, however, are sub-resolution and thus too small to be detected directly by Diviner. But near Noon, because they are surrounded by the otherwise warm (illuminated) regolith, multispectral observations should result in anisothermal behavior (i.e. variable brightness temperature as a function of wavelength due to the uniqueness of Planck curves associated with black or grey bodies). Deconvolving these Planck curves yields the properties of the end members (fractional area and brightness temperature), demonstrating that micro-cold traps could be present in the field of view, although not resolved. This approach has been successfully used to map sub-resolution rocks or Mars and the Moon, leveraging the fact that rocks are warmer at night than the surrounding terrains due to their high thermal inertias. Anisothermality has been indeed observed at various locations of the South Pole, with cold end-members consistent with water ice trapping temperatures (110 K or lower), and warm surrounding regolith. Areal fraction of micro-cold trap can mathematically can range from 40 to 100% to match the observations (depending on the temperature of the warm endmember) but should realistically remain closer to the lower bound. Future lunar sampling missions may want to consider sampling micro cold traps."
