      abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of binary mixtures comprising 2-hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate (HEHN) and hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) were conducted using the polarizable APPLE&P force field to investigate fundamental properties of multimode propulsion (MMP) propellants. Calculated densities as a function of temperature were in good agreement with experiments and similar simulations. The structural properties of neat HEHN and HAN–HEHN provided insights into their inherent, protic nature. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) identified key hydrogen bonding sites located at N–H···O and O–H···O within a first solvation shell of approximately 2 Å. Angular distribution functions further affirmed the relatively strong nature of the hydrogen bonds with nearly linear directionality. The increased hydroxylammonium cation (HA+) mole fraction shows the influence of competitively strong hydrogen bonds on the overall hydrogen bond network. Dominant spatial motifs via three-dimensional distribution functions along with nearly nanosecond-long hydrogen bond lifetimes highlight the local bonding environment that may precede proton transfer reactions.},

      abstract = {In this study, we investigate the quaternary ammonium-based ionic liquid (QAIL), methyltrioctylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [N1888][TFSI], utilizing small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements and polarizable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the short- and long-range liquid structure. Scattering structure factors show signatures of three length scales in reciprocal space indicative of alternating polarity (k ∼ 0.44 Å–1), charge (k ∼ 0.75 Å–1), and neighboring or adjacent (k ∼ 1.46 Å–1) domains. Excellent agreement between simulation and experimental scattering structure factors validates various simulation analyses that provide detailed atomistic characterization of the different length scale correlations. The first solvation shell structure is illustrated by obtaining radial, angular, dihedral, and combined distribution functions, where two dominant spatial motifs, N+···N– and N+···O–, compete for optimal packing around the polar head of the [N1888]+ cation. Intermediate and long-range structures are governed by the balance between local electroneutrality and octyl chain networking, respectively. By computing the charge-correlation structure factor, SZZ, and the spatial extent of the octyl chain network using graph theory, the bulk-phase structure of [N1888][TFSI] is characterized in terms of electrostatic screening and apolar domain formation length scales. },
