This study explores the application of Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict viscosity of ionic liquids. The research demonstrates how SVR can effectively model the complex relationships between molecular structure and viscosity in ionic liquid systems.

Key findings include the superior performance of SVR in capturing non-linear relationships between ionic liquid properties and viscosity. The study also highlights how water concentration detection serves as a powerful tool for outlier identification, showing that anomalous viscosity measurements can often be attributed to unaccounted water contamination.
